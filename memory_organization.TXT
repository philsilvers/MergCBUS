Memory organization
512 bytes is the max value for simple arduino
byte=value;explanation
0xaa ; indicates that it is a merg arduino memory storage
can_id;store the can_id
hh Node number;high byte from node number
ll Node number;low byte from node number
flags ; 1 byte
device number:32 bytes allowing 16 device numbers
amount of node variables ; 1 byte
amount of learned events;1 byte
?amount of learned event variables;1 byte
20 bytes for node variables
100 bytes for 25 learned events
450 bytes for learned event variables. 2 bytes for each variable. max of 8 vars per event. 1st is the event number index. the index is the position of the event in the memory range from 0 to 24
